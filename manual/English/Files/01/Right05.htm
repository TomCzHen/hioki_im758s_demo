	<h2>About the Status Byte Register</h2>
    <div class="contents">
        <p>The Status Byte Register contains information about the event registers and the output queue.</p>
        <p>Required items are selected from this information by masking with the Service Request Enable Register.</p>
        <p>When any bit selected by the mask is set, bit 6 (MSS; the Master Summary Status) of the Status Byte Register is also set, which generates an SRQ (Service Request) message and dispatches a service request.</p>

        <p class="note"><span class="note">For RS-232C, USB and LAN bit 4 (MAV message available) of the status byte register is not set.</span></p>

    <h3>Status Byte Register (STB)</h3>
    	<div class="contents">
        	<p>A status byte register is an 8-bit register output from the unit to the controller during serial polling.</p>
			<p>If even one of the status byte register bits enabled by the service request enable register changes from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;1,&quot; the MSS bit becomes 1.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the SRQ bit also becomes &quot;1&quot; and a service request is generated.</p>
			<br>
            <p>The SRQ bit is always synchronized with the service request and only read and simultaneously cleared upon being serial polled.</p>
        	<p>The MSS bit is only read by an &quot;*STB?&quot; query and is not cleared until the event is cleared by a command such as a &quot;*CLS&quot; command.</p>

	<h3>Service Request Enable Register (SRER)</h3>
    	<div class="contents">
        	<p>When the service request enable register is used to set each of the bits to &quot;1&quot;the corresponding bits are enabled in the status byte register.</p>
