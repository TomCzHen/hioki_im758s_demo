    <h3>Output Queue</h3>
   	<div class="contents">
    	<p class="sub">The output queue is the area in the unit where response messages are stored.</p>
        <p class="sub">Stored response messages are cleared once they are read by the controller of the PC. The output queue is also cleared at the following times.</p>
        <p class="sub"><img src="img/fig4_1.png"></p>
        <p class="sub">The output queue of the unit is 10KB. If a response message exceeds this size, a query error is generated and the output buffer is cleared.</p>
        <p class="sub">For GP-IB, the output queue is cleared and a query error is generated if a new message is received when there is data in the output queue.</p>  
    </div>

    <h3>Input Buffer</h3>
   	<div class="contents">
    	<p class="sub">The input buffer is the area in the unit where received data is stored.</p>
    	<p class="sub">The input buffer is 10KB.</p>
    	<p class="sub">If data exceeding 10KB was sent and the input buffer becomes full, the GP-IB interface bus enters a wait state until free space becomes available.</p>
    	<p class="sub">RS-232C, USB and LAN cannot receive data that exceeds 10KB.</p>
        <div class="sub">
        	<p class="note"><span class="note">Keep the length of one command under 10KB.</span></p>
